                                <strong>Great Agent </strong><br>
                                &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br> I want to thank Anup for selling our home so quickly and over list price. Anup is all business and very thorough. You can trust Anup. His marketing skills are incredible. He brilliantly planted the sign on our lawn before the listing became active. This made local residents aware that our home was available and generated even more activity. His staff are equally professional. I am recommending Anup to friends and family.  <br>                      
   </p>
                          <br>  <p>
                                <strong>Best there is</strong><br>
                                &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br>
                                  With the help of Anup, my house was sold in less than two weeks. He has an extensive knowledge about the real estate business in general but with expertise in the GTA market in particular. He works in partnership with you (the client) and never pressures you to make any hasty decisions about selling or buying. He encourages you to explore all options in order for you to make an informed decision.
Most importantly, when you have Anup on your side, you are always a winner   <br>           
                               </p>

                                <strong>BETTER THAN ANYONE</strong><br>
                                &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br>
                                   Anup was a very attentive, hard working agent. He always had the best interests of my elderly father and was very considerate and professional in all our interactions. Thank you Anup for selling my fathers house for well over the asking price and in only five days and for helping him to find a beautiful new condo to move in to!
                         </p><br>
                            <p>
                                <strong> Amazing!</strong><br>
                                &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;<br>
                                   I have done a variety of real estate transactions with Anup since 2016 :
selling under a power of sale and buying some bungalows in Scarborough and selling a century-old 2 storey rental property and a vacant building lot in Hamilton.  I have found him very professional, knowledgeable, personable and a GREAT negotiator. He deals well with other agents, even if they keep asking what seem like irrelevant questions to us. He will spend time doing multiple sign-backs and/or offers and driving out of town if needed. He keeps his clients informed about the process, listings they might be interested in and the market in general.  He makes good use of modern technology and usually returns calls, messages and e-mails promptly.
Whether you are buying or selling, Anup gets the job done effectively!                        </p>
